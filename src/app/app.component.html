<h4>
  Repro Steps:
  <pre>
    Don't type anything in and click "Touch Address Control".
    This is simply calling "markAsTouched()" on the parent address
    control.
    
    <u>Expected behavior</u>: The OnTouched() method of the 
    AddressComponent would trigger, setting the "false" value
    to "true".

    <u>Current Behavior</u>: Only the top-level form control
    named "address" is marked as touched. That change is not
    propagated to the actual component via the ControlValueAccessor.

  </pre>
